# Climate Change Belief Analysis

With climate change considered a problem throughout the world many companies have taken the initiative to develop enviromentally friendly products and services to aim in lessening their carbon footprint. These companies, however, often find it difficult to guage how their products and services may be percieved and therefore require a means of determining people's views on climate change. By analysing tweets about climate change the sentiment/opinion of the person writing that tweet can be captured and used to provide insight into who is anti or pro climate change and thus guide companies of who to target their products/services to. In this classification problem the aim was to accurately classify sentiments for a collection of tweets about climate change. To do this, LinearSVC, Naive Bayes Multinomial, Random Forest, KNeighbors and Logistic Regression classifier algorithms were used to build models to classify/predict tweet sentiments. Each of the models were assessed using several classification metrics, with the LinearSVC classifier displaying the best scores for the data at hand. We subsequently used a Grid Search to improve on the hyperparameters of LinearSVC in an attempt to improve its classifying ability.

Climate change is the phenomenon of an increasing number of greenhouse gases within the earth's atmosphere that is accompanied by major shifts in weather patterns. This is largely human-induced and is a result of increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels for basic living neccesities as well as large industrial processes. The effects of climate change affect the livelihoods of both people and animals and is experienced via intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans. Furthermore, as climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe.

Over several years, many companies have attempted to implement strategies around lessening their environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. However, problems they experience include guaging how their products may be recieved based on people's views and opinions of climate change. By determining how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat, these companies can improve on their market research efforts. Additionally, access to a large collection of consumer sentiments that also spans multiple demographic and geographic categories will influence company insights and their future marketing strategies allowing them to find the right target market to direct their products and efforts toward.

In the context of climate change and sustainable companies, we aim to provide a means for such companies to determine the views or sentiments of people towards climate change. To do this, tweets pertaining to climate change will be looked at and used to train a classification model in order to accurately classify the opinions behind those tweets, into those who believe in climate change and those who do not. This notebook details the work flow of us building, training and assessing different classifier models to provide a suitable solution that can be implemented in future marketing strategies of climate concious companies.
